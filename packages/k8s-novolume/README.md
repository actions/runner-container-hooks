# K8s Novolume Hooks

## Description
This implementation provides a way to dynamically spin up pods to run container workflows, rather then relying on the default docker implementation. It is meant to be used when the runner itself is running in k8s, for example when using the [Actions Runner Controller](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller)

Unlike the [k8s hooks](../k8s/README.md), the job pods do not mount the runner's workspace volume. Instead, the workspace and the internal directories are copied into the job pod using the Kubernetes `exec` API, and copied back once the step completes. This removes the need for a `ReadWriteMany` volume (or for pinning every job pod to the runner's node), at the cost of the time it takes to copy the assets for every step.

Use these hooks when shared storage is not available in your cluster. Otherwise, prefer the [k8s hooks](../k8s/README.md), which are significantly faster.

## Pre-requisites 
Some things are expected to be set when using these hooks
- The runner itself should be running in a pod, with a service account with the following permissions
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: runner-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "delete"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/exec"]
  verbs: ["get", "create"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch",]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "delete"]
```
- The `ACTIONS_RUNNER_POD_NAME` env should be set to the name of the pod
- The `ACTIONS_RUNNER_REQUIRE_JOB_CONTAINER` env should be set to true to prevent the runner from running any jobs outside of a container
- The runner pod should map a persistent volume claim into the `_work` directory
    - The `ACTIONS_RUNNER_CLAIM_NAME` env should be set to the persistent volume claim that contains the runner's working directory, otherwise it defaults to `${ACTIONS_RUNNER_POD_NAME}-work`
- Some actions runner env's are expected to be set. These are set automatically by the runner.
    - `RUNNER_WORKSPACE` is expected to be set to the workspace of the runner
    - `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` is expected to be set to the workspace of the job


## Limitations
- A [job containers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container) will be required for all jobs
- Building container actions from a dockerfile is not supported at this time
- Container actions will not have access to the services network or job container network
- Docker [create options](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontaineroptions) are not supported
- Container actions will have to specify the entrypoint, since the default entrypoint will be overridden to run the commands from the workflow.
- Container actions need to have the following binaries in their container image: `sh`, `env`, `tail`.
